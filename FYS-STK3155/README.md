# FYS-STK3155

Project 1 in FYS-STK 3155/4155


Abstract 

In this project I will analyzing three different regression methods, the ordinary least square, Ridge
and Lasso. The regression models was scored on two different datasets, one given by an analytical
function, the Franke function with some stochastic noise, the other a terrain dataset from an area
close to Stavanger, Norway. The findings show a improvement of the performance of the model with
regularization for the analytical sourced dataset, but that this benefit was not present in the terrain
data.

The written report can be found as a pdf in the folder "Report". 

The code is contained in the jupyter notebook found in the folder "Jupyter Notebook". 

The folder "Runs" contains a pdf print of the jupyter notebook.
