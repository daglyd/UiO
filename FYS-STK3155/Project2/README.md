# FYS-STK3155

Project 2 in FYS-STK 3155/4155


Abstract 

In this project I will be writing a neural network class to employ at both regression and classification tasks. 
The network will be compared with both linear regression with and without regularization including a Scikit-learn neural net. 
Neural networks as proves to be stable on regression
tasks and avoids over fitting, this is also true for the Ridge regression. On the classification task
the neural networks performs very well, but are dependent on the learning rate and not so much
the regularization parameter, this seems to change when adding more layers.


The written report can be found as a pdf in the folder "Report". 

The code is in two jupyter notebooks in the outer folder.

The folder "Runs" contains a pdf print of the jupyter notebook.
